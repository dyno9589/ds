RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a Java API used for implementing distributed systems. It allows Java objects to invoke methods on remote Java objects running on different JVMs (Java Virtual Machines).

Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of how to implement a multi-threaded client/server process communication using RMI, broken down into points:

Define the Remote Interface:
Create a Java interface that extends java.rmi.Remote.
Define the methods that will be invoked remotely. These methods should throw java.rmi.RemoteException.

Implement the Remote Interface:
Create a class that implements the remote interface.
Extend java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject to make the class remotely accessible.
Implement the methods defined in the remote interface.

Create the Server:
Instantiate the remote implementation class.
Bind the remote object to a specific name in the RMI registry using java.rmi.Naming.rebind() or java.rmi.registry.Registry.bind().
Start the RMI registry using java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry.createRegistry().

Create the Client:
Look up the remote object from the RMI registry using java.rmi.Naming.lookup() or java.rmi.registry.Registry.lookup().
Invoke remote methods on the remote object.
Handle Multi-Threading:
To handle multiple clients simultaneously, use a multi-threaded server.
Each client connection should be handled in a separate thread.
Use java.lang.Thread or java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService to manage threads.

Error Handling and Exception Management:
Handle exceptions that may occur during RMI communication, such as java.rmi.RemoteException.
Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
